# ALU Simulation
The PRISM ALU was built to perform 8 operations including: AND, NEG (2s complement), NOT (invert), ROR, OR, IN, ADD, LD. Below is the output for a working ALU simulation.

The arithmatic operation performed by the ALU is controlled by the OPCODE, labeled OpSel below. The following list matches the opcode with the desired operation.
  0   |  : AND
  1   |  : NEG (2s complement)
  2   |  : NOT (invert)
  3   |  : ROR
  4   |  : OR
  5   |  : IN
  6   |  : ADD
  7   |  : LD
